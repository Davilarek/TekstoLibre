# TekstoLibre
A free &amp; open source Tekstowo front-end.

It currently uses latest build of [Tekstowo-Unofficial-API](https://github.com/Davilarek/Tekstowo-Unofficial-API) with SirJoshProxy option.
## Self-hosting
I recommend using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but soon I will write a server for this (currently this project targets Github Pages).
